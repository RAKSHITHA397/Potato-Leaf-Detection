#  Objective

To classify potato leaf images as **healthy** or **infected** using deep learning techniques.

# Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Colab (optional)

  # How to Run

1. Clone this repo or upload files to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Run `training.ipynb`.
3. View outputs & accuracy results.
4. Predict on test images.

# Dataset

Images of potato leaves, categorized by disease and health condition.
(You can use PlantVillage dataset or your own images.)

 # Model

- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Image preprocessing, augmentation, training, evaluation
